# programming-problems
This repo is a collection of code I've written to solve programming problems.
It is intended as a example of my code, not as a tool for others. I encourage
others to do their own work to solve the problems I have solved for their own
benefit.

Many of the problems come from https://projecteuler.net/ which I recommend
checking out. This repo is not intended to show solutions for others.
Therefore, I have taken a few minimal steps to make this repo less visible to
search engines for people looking to find answers. If you have suggestions on
how to obscure the problems more, feel free to open an issue or even PR.
